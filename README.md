# twitter-reports
Front to back app that shows Twitter information (trending, top users, top countries etc)

Front end is written in React / Redux (and possibly with some Elm for good measures)

Server is written in Go

Communication between front end and server is websockets for realtime publication and RESTful calls for request/response

Data is stored in MongoDb with Elastic search for more flexible queries
